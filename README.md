Detectify Welcome Challenge
=========================

Welcome to the Detectify Crowdsource application challenge! To run the challenge, navigate to the directory to where you
saved the challenge and run the following command in your terminal: 

```
▶ docker-compose up --build
```

If you're having issues with getting the challenge running, try running a build with `--no-cache` and trying again:

```
▶ docker-compose build --no-cache
▶ docker-compose up

```

You should then be able to access the challenge at http://localhost:31337/. If you have any questions you can reach
us at crowdsource@detectify.com.

Good luck!
